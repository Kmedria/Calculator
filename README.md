This Calculator is 1 cpp file that allows the user to enter lines of 127 chars and then reads those charecters as a line of maths and outputs the result.

The caculator can process +- * (as multiply) and / (as divide).
The calculator follows BODMAS and users can use brackets too.
Decimals must ne used with a '.' rather than a ',' : so like 1.1 not 1,1.

If the calculator cannot recognise a part of the equation than it will not output any result and ouput and error alongside an arrow that shows the charecter that caused the error. The user can then tell whta part of their equation has issues.

The image above shows a couple sample equations i created and the responses from the caluculator. The calculator has not undergone any rigorous testing as of yet.
